# afms
An old (2016) project.  Part of it for school (msim 751) and part for work (afms python code).

The description below applies to the cpp project.  I also tried a 4D concolutional NN using tensorflow.

## Deep Belief Network
- Like a Bayesian network but we donâ€™t assume prior knowledge of features, patterns, or causalities
- Constructed of restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) layers
  - Each layer has many nodes and therefore many parameters
  - Once trained, these layers and their weight matrices will form our probabilistic model
